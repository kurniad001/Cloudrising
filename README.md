#Grandmaster-Plan
================
To build an alternative social and cultural framework to allow the attainment of physical and mental freedom for each human person. This project aims to create an executable open-sourced plan to redesign the way our society functions, in favor of more evenly distributed bottom-up systems.


##Problems with the current framework

- Uneven distribution of resources - income inequality, hunger/starvation [still an issue](https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats)
- Access to Food/Water/Shelter for all people have not yet been achieved
- Cultural & technologial progress clogged with patents and copyrights
- Most people stuck doing jobs they dont want to do.
- Loneliness & Depression as an epidemic


##What we should achieve as a species

- Every person should have the ability to acheive self-sufficiency
- Every person should be equipped with the neccesary tools and information to trade goods and services in a free market.
- Every person should have the freedom to live anywhere on earth.
- A framework that allows free transfer and evolution of information & culture.


##how should it be done: (plan requirements)

- plan is required to be executable from the current framework.
- This plan should make use of the most up-to-date tools and techniques we have available, 
the plan will be updated as new tools become available.
